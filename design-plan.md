# Website Design Plan

## Overall Structure
The website will follow a minimalist design with interactive 3D elements powered by Three.js. The layout will be clean and focused on content while providing engaging visual experiences.

## Pages/Sections
1. **Home/Landing Page**
   - Minimalist 3D scene as background (possibly abstract geometric shapes or a stylized 3D environment)
   - Name and brief introduction
   - Navigation to other sections
   - Subtle animations to engage visitors

2. **Work Experience**
   - Interactive timeline or 3D representation of career progression
   - Details for each position:
     - Software Engineer Intern at Immersive Reality Labs NUS
     - Software Engineer Intern at NUS Enterprise

3. **Projects**
   - Interactive 3D gallery or showcase
   - Featured projects:
     - FlareGate (ETH Oxford Hackathon winner)
     - 24x365 (AI-Powered Calendar Application)
   - Each project with description, technologies used, and outcomes

4. **Other Activities**
   - Creative visualization of various roles and activities
   - Categories:
     - Leadership (Business Development Lead, Badminton Captain)
     - Education (Peer Tutor, Student Ambassador)
     - Athletics (Varsity Athlete)

5. **Contact/Footer**
   - Minimal contact information
   - Social media links
   - Download CV option

## Navigation
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Minimalist navigation menu (fixed position)
- Visual indicators for current section

## Three.js Implementation
1. **Background Elements**
   - Low-poly 3D environment or abstract geometric shapes
   - Subtle movement responding to cursor/scroll
   - Particle effects for transitions

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - 3D models representing work experiences
   - Interactive project showcases
   - Hover effects with 3D transformations

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Progressive loading of 3D elements
   - Level of detail adjustments based on device capability
   - Fallbacks for devices with limited WebGL support

## Visual Design
1. **Color Scheme**
   - Primary: Dark background with light text for contrast
   - Accent: Strategic use of vibrant colors for highlighting important elements
   - Overall: Monochromatic with accent colors

2. **Typography**
   - Sans-serif fonts for clean, modern look
   - Consistent hierarchy for headings and body text
   - Minimal use of different font weights and styles

3. **Spacing and Layout**
   - Generous whitespace to maintain minimalist aesthetic
   - Grid-based layout for consistency
   - Strategic use of asymmetry for visual interest

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Simplified 3D elements on mobile devices
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile users

## Animation and Transitions
- Subtle animations for page transitions
- Interactive elements respond to user input
- Scroll-triggered animations for content reveal
- Performance-optimized animation techniques
